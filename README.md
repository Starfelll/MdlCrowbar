# MdlCrowbar  
 ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/MdlCrowbar?logo=nuget&label=MdlCrowbar)   
 .NET library for loading Source1/GoldSrc model (.mdl, .vtx, .vvd, .phy).  
 

Modified version of [Crowbar](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar).
Removed unnecessary code and retained the part that parses mdl.
